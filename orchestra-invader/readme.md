Attempted bonus option1

Theme: Player as the director of a poorly trained orchestra tries to bring a music piece to its end. 
The director taps a stick(tap sound replaces shoot.wav) to signal stop (a rest symbol is shot at the orchestra). If 
a performer receives the signal, then he/she will close the music sheet (paper flip sound when enemy is destroyed) 
and stop playing (disappear from the screen). The orchestra performers sometimes play a wrong note. If a wrong note 
reaches the director or if the orchestra is too close to the director, the director will lose pitch and fails to 
conclude the music piece.

Bonus Feature: Player can fire a special type of bullet - fermata (hotkey: W). If fermata hits any enemy, all enemies
will stay in place for 2 seconds. 
Player has 3 fermatas every game. The number of fermatas remaining is shown at the top of the game screen.

General Rules: 
- Player shoot bullets at enemies, attempting to clear out all enemies before enemies reach the director. 
- Enemies speed up as more enemies are killed, and as level increases. 
- Player must hide from all enemies' bullets, and enemies' fire rate increases as level increases.
- If enemies reach the bottom of the pane or if player is struck by a bullet, one life is lost and the enemies respawn from the top in the current level.
- Scores accumulate until all three lives are used.
- Player can switch to a different level in the middle of the game. If the level is switch, the game will restart and scores, lives,and fermatas will reset.

Scoring Rules: 
Every enemy in level1 is worth 10 points.\
Every enemy in level2 is worth 20 points.\
Every enemy in level3 is worth 40 points.
